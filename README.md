# Air quality in Beijing (Air quality index (AQI) and PM2.5 air pollution in Beijing)
The goal of this project is to take the publically available Beijing weather data from 2013 to 2017 and apply machine learning techniques to see if we can predict the amount of PM2.5 concentration in the air given other environmental features.
